            Data Security<br />
            We use commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures
            to help secure and safeguard your data in our possession. However,
            no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure and no
            security mechanism is impenetrable. Therefore, although we take
            steps to protect your data, we cannot guarantee the security of the
            data that we collect from you or the security of our servers or the
            Site. By accessing the Site, any transmission of data is at your own
            risk and you agree to assume all risk in connection with data sent
            to us or collected by us.

            retain your data for longer periods of time as necessary to comply
